## Project Description
 ### Tableau Public Link
  - xyz.com
  - This repository is for the final project of MGT 4250 at Elon University
  - This datasetlooks at player per-game and advanced statistics for the NBA's 2022-23 season with player salary data, creating a comprehensive resource for understanding the performance and financial aspects of professional basketball players. 
### Project Questions
 - What performance metrics and player attributes contriubute to higher salaries?
 - Is there a way we can use previous performance to predict player salaries?
 ### Importance
- This question is important for teams and management to see where their salaries are being allocated and best utilized. This is needed going into drafts, agency, trading players, and renewing contracts while staying within your budget and measuring performance.
- These questions are important to me because it finds a way to utilize the skills I've learned in MGT 4250 for a topic I'm passionate about - sports.
