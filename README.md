## Project Description
 ### Tableau Public Link
  - xyz.com
  - This repository is for the final project of MGT 4250 at Elon University
  - This datasetlooks at player per-game and advanced statistics for the NBA's 2022-23 season with player salary data, creating a comprehensive resource for understanding the performance and financial aspects of professional basketball players. 
### Project Questions
 - What performance metrics and player attributes contriubute to higher salaries?
 ### Importance
- This question is important for teams and management to see where their salaries are being allocated and best utilized. This is needed going into drafts, agency, trading players, and renewing contracts while staying within your budget and measuring performance.
- These questions are important to me because it finds a way to utilize the skills I've learned in MGT 4250 for a topic I'm passionate about - sports.

## Interpreting Visualizations
- This visualization shows average points per game per position. Measurin gpoints is a good thing to look at because you need points to win games and you need to win games to make money (ticket sales, fan engagement, post-season opportunities). This visualization breaks it down by position so we can see which positions might pull more weight in winning games and is important to the question by outlining baselines of performance.

 - This visualization shows shooting percentages by position and type of shot. This is similar to the last visual and its importance to the question because it breaks things down by which position is making the most shots at the highest rate and what shots can contribute to winning games.

 - This visual combines the last few showing the average salary based on position AND total shooting percentage. In a logicial mindset, you would think that the players that score the most points should get paid the most based on their performance but this shows almost the complete opposite. Players that have the highest shooting percentage earn the least, and players that have the smallest shooting percentage average the most. This graph and dataset doesn't factor in outside elements that could contribute to salary. This is important to the question to show that you might not be able to determine salary based on performance.

 - This final visualization shows a scatter plot of average salary by position and team. This outlines where teams are currently allocating all of their wages. Despite cetners and shooting guards having higher overall shooting percentages, power forwards and point guards make significantly more money. Those latter positions do tend to average a few points higher per game, but they are also the positions that are making the big 3 point shots and commanding the ball on the court. This visualization is important to teams as leverage against the rest of the NBA for player salaries and to again highlight that it is not always performance that is a factor. Other elements include social media follwoing, fan engagement and fan favorite players, celebrity status, etc.
